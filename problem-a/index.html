    <p> Frodo Baggins is a young Hobbit from the Shire who enjoys eating and smoking pipeweed and spending time 
        with his friends Samwise, Merry, and Pippin. He is Bilbo Baggins cousin and adopted son. At the behest of the 
        wizard Gandalf, Frodo eventually embarks on a long 
        and grand journey to destroy the One Ring along with those chosen to be in the fellowship of the 
        ring. He is the carrier of the ring as he is deemed the one who can manage to hold
        the ring without being fully corrupted. In his journey he overcomes otherworldly evils and strange forces that try to stop him
        at every chance. His travels are documented in the <cite>Lord of The 
        Rings</cite> trilogy of books written by J.R.R Tolkien. More information can be found in the Lord of the Rings 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings"> wikipedia page </a>.  Some reasons 
        I admire Frodo are listed below. </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li class="highlightedfact">He has really impressive long distance endurance/hiking skills</li>
        <li>He makes excellent food and appreciates the importance of breakfast</li> 
        <li>He seems like a really relaxed guy when he is not being possesed by evil forces</li> 
        <li>He helps throw really fun parties with great magic tricks </li>
    </ul>
