    <p> Frodo is a Hobbit from the Shire. He enjoys eating and smoking pipeweed and spending time 
        with his friends. He is Bilbo Baggins cousin
        and adopted son. He has a best friend named Samwise Gamgee and is 
        also friends with the wizard Gandalf. He eventually embarks on a long 
        and grand journey to destroy the One Ring along with the fellowship of the 
        ring. He is the carrier of the ring as he is deemed the one who can carry
        the ring without being corrupted. His journeys are documented in the <cite>Lord of The 
        Rings</cite> trilogy written by J.R.R Tolkien. More information can be found in the Lord of the Rings 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings"> wikipedia page </a>.  Some reasons 
        I admire Frodo are listed below. </p>
